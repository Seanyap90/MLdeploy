<h1>ML powered Condition Monitoring Dashboard </h1>

<h2>Preview</h2>
<p>I am trying to convert a couple of data science projects in relation to Kaggle's solar generation dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data into an exemplary and conceptual application.</p>
<p>This means that we will have a couple of features on the dashboard UI being influenced by end-to-end ML deployments which include both training and inference.</p>


<h3>Version 1: Condition monitoring by setting hard thresholds</h3>
